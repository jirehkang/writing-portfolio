# Jireh Kang's Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my writing portfolio â€” a curated collection of technical and UX writing samples.

Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), this responsive site demonstrates my ability to work with static site generators. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build and style the website.
