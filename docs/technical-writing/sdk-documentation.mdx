## Project overview

As a technical writer at Sendbird, a leading B2B chat platform, I maintained and improved the Chat SDK documentation to support developers integrating chat features across multiple platforms.

_Note: All content was written by me, except for the code samples._

## Scope of work

- Rewrote an existing SDK documentation to clarify the different methods of resource retrieval based on its type.
- Partnered with engineers to improve code snippets to include a more helpful example.
- Incorporated feedback from internal teams and external users to address common questions and align the content with real-world use cases.

## Outcome

- Improved documentation clarity, reducing confusion around complex behavior.
- Contributed to more robust sample code, making implementation easier for developers.
