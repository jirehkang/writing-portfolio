Sendbird  |  Summer 2022 


## About the project

Sendbird, a leading B2B chat platform, introduced a new feature called Polls which enables participants to create and vote in polls directly within conversations, making in-chat interactions more engaging. 

I was the sole technical writer for this project in a cross-functional team that included backend and SDK engineers, a product designer, and a product manager. 

## My tasks

I was responsible for the following documentation deliverables, all released in sync with the feature launch:
- Code naming review
- API reference documentation
- SDK documentation for iOS, Android, and JavaScript

All content was written by me, except for the code samples.

### Code naming review

I started by consulting internal specifications to understand both the user-facing and technical aspects of the Polls feature. I collaborated with engineers to review and refine customer-facing code names, such as endpoints, resource properties, and SDK methods, to ensure clarity and consistency with other Sendbird products.
