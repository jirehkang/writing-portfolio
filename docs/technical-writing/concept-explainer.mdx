_Note: All content was written by me._

## Scope of work

- Researched and synthesized information about Node.js, including its origin, architecture (event loop, non-blocking I/O), and how it differs from traditional server-side environments.
- Explained technical concepts in plain language to ensure accessibility for readers of all skill levels.
- Organized content to follow Codecademy’s guidelines for SEO, style, and structure.

## Outcome

- Delivered foundational knowledge about the history, architecture, advantages, and limitations of Node.js in a clear and engaging way.
- Highlights practical applications and use cases where Node.js excels, helping readers understand when and why to use Node.js.
