# API & SDK Docs for Polls

## Background

Upon release of a new feature that attaches polls to messages, I was tasked with updating Sendbirdâ€™s API documentation to explain the feature. 

## My tasks



### Code naming review

### API reference

### SDK documentation

- Educated developers on new REST API endpoints as well as the benefits, prerequisites, and limitations of the new feature in a clear, concise manner. The API document was used as a basis for developing the corresponding SDK documents.

- Improved the organization of the documentation by making recommendations on style and structure.
