Sendbird | March 2022

## Project overview

As a technical writer at Sendbird, a leading B2B chat platform, I created a user guide for the Agents feature in Sendbird's customer support chat product called Desk.

_Note: All content was created by me, except for the images which were based on drafts I provided._

# Scope of work

- Developed a guide that serves as a one-stop resource for understanding the Agents feature and using it within the Desk dashboard.
- Collaborated with a product designer to create visuals that enhance comprehension and usability.

## Outcome

- Improved navigation of the feature within the Desk dashboard by clearly explaining agent roles, behaviors, and functions in context.
- Standardized agent-related terminology and organized the content in a logical, easy-to-follow format to support onboarding and daily use.
