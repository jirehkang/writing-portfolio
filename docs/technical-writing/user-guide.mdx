## Project overview

As a technical writer at Sendbird, a leading B2B chat platform, I created a user guide covering all functions of the Agent feature in Sendbird’s Desk product.

_Note: All content was created by me, except for the final images, which were based on drafts I provided._

# Scope of work

- Developed a comprehensive guide that provides helpful knowledge and instructions.
- Collaborated with a product designer to create visuals that enhance understanding and usability.

## Outcome

- Delivered a centralized knowledge base for support agents using the Desk dashboard, improving onboarding and reducing repetitive support inquiries.
- Fostered alignment across teams by clarifying agent-related terminology and designing a clear, hierarchical information structure that guides users through each aspect of the feature.
