_Note: All content in the above page was written or edited by me. Other pages of the website have been modified since my time at the firm._

## Scope of work

- Wrote and edited copy for key pages, including service descriptions, bios, and navigation menus, with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and professionalism.
- Localized content based on Korean source copy, adapting language and tone to suit an international audience while maintaining fidelity to the original meaning.

## Outcome

- Delivered a seamless content experience that better supported international clients and prospects.
- Reinforced the firm’s credibility and global image through clear, consistent, and brand-aligned language.
